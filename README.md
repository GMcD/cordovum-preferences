Applications Preferences Cordova Plugin
=======================================

The Application Preferences plugin expects the Cordova Network Information plugin to be installed, currently. This dependency will be removed in a later version.

To Install

```
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.network-information
cordova plugin add https://github.com/GMcD/cordovum-preferences.git
```

The plugin incorporates a Settings bundle for iOS and a preferences xml file for Android.
